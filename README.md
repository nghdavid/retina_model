Simulation of feedforward and feedback inhibition and gain control in retina <br> 
Two kinds of model can explain neural mechanism of motion prediction (constant velocity moving bar and stochastic moving bar) in retina  <br> 
The gain control model is based on this [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/18678)
The details of feedforward and feedback network is described in my [thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fvfjI5-MXvPIgsAYZ3Z8eDEjvK9aB702/view?usp=sharing)
Code is written in python  and the form is jupyter notbook. <br>
